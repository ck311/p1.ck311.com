<h3>"So what, exactly, do you do?"</h3>
<p>I work in the Harvard Law School Office of Communications as the primary news content editor and CMS sufferer. Our team has recently begun work on a new project which will have us building a news site in WordPress, so I am taking the opportunity to strengthen my dev skills to become as involved in as possible--or, at least, conversant--in all aspects of the project.</p>
